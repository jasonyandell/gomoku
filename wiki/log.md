# Gomoku Wiki Log

Chronological record of wiki maintenance. Keep entries append-only and use a
consistent heading so future sessions can scan recent changes with simple tools.

## [2026-05-19] setup | LLM wiki operating model

- Added [index.md](index.md) as the wiki entry point and content catalog.
- Added [topics/wiki-operating-model.md](topics/wiki-operating-model.md) to adapt
  the Karpathy LLM wiki pattern to this repo.
- Added [sources/karpathy-llm-wiki.md](sources/karpathy-llm-wiki.md) as the
  source record for the organizing charter.
- Updated [../AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) and [../TRAINING_WIKI.md](../TRAINING_WIKI.md)
  so future sessions treat the wiki as a compounding synthesis layer, not just a
  large experiment transcript.

## [2026-05-19] synthesis | MCTS perf ceiling topic page

- Added [topics/mcts-perf-ceiling.md](topics/mcts-perf-ceiling.md) capturing
  the finding that our `gomoku/mcts.py` is already at the AGZ "mcts_v2"
  storage layout that other AZ codebases advertise as a big upgrade. Ports
  of that design are a no-op for us.
- The cross-game BFS-vectorized descent (Exp 9 in
  [../TRAINING_WIKI.md](../TRAINING_WIKI.md)) is real but small: 1.26× at
  G=32 / wave=16, ~1.05–1.10× at our dist G=8 / wave=32 config. The next
  2× requires batched `state.apply` on tensor, C-extension `_init_node`,
  or multi-device gen-vs-train split — not numpy reshuffling.
- Updated [index.md](index.md) Start Here table to surface the new topic.
