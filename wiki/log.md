# Gomoku Wiki Log

Chronological record of wiki maintenance. Keep entries append-only and use a
consistent heading so future sessions can scan recent changes with simple tools.

## [2026-05-19] setup | LLM wiki operating model

- Added [index.md](index.md) as the wiki entry point and content catalog.
- Added [topics/wiki-operating-model.md](topics/wiki-operating-model.md) to adapt
  the Karpathy LLM wiki pattern to this repo.
- Added [sources/karpathy-llm-wiki.md](sources/karpathy-llm-wiki.md) as the
  source record for the organizing charter.
- Updated [../AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) and [../TRAINING_WIKI.md](../TRAINING_WIKI.md)
  so future sessions treat the wiki as a compounding synthesis layer, not just a
  large experiment transcript.

## [2026-05-19] synthesis | MCTS perf ceiling topic page

- Added [topics/mcts-perf-ceiling.md](topics/mcts-perf-ceiling.md) capturing
  the finding that our `gomoku/mcts.py` is already at the AGZ "mcts_v2"
  storage layout that other AZ codebases advertise as a big upgrade. Ports
  of that design are a no-op for us.
- The cross-game BFS-vectorized descent (Exp 9 in
  [../TRAINING_WIKI.md](../TRAINING_WIKI.md)) is real but small: 1.26× at
  G=32 / wave=16, ~1.05–1.10× at our dist G=8 / wave=32 config. The next
  2× requires batched `state.apply` on tensor, C-extension `_init_node`,
  or multi-device gen-vs-train split — not numpy reshuffling.
- Updated [index.md](index.md) Start Here table to surface the new topic.

## [2026-05-19] notebook | az-recipe-160k launched, first sustained heuristic crossing

- Live run `9x9-sweep-az-recipe-160k` (wandb `sppjo3z5`) is at e1285 with
  heuristic 50-70% sustained across e1119/1179/1227 — never seen in dist
  mode before. Prior best dist crossing was fresh-dist plateauing at ~35%
  by e552; all other dist cells stayed at 0% heuristic for the entire 100
  epochs they ran.
- Launched config differs from the documented recipe: small model +
  stem_padding=1 + sims=400 (instead of medium / 3 / 800) to keep wall-
  clock inside one day on the M5 Max. The recipe defaults benched at
  ~30 s/cycle = ~46h for 5000 cycles; trimmed config is ~2 s/cycle when
  games are short.
- Captured Jason's calibration that cycle-time scales super-linearly
  with mean plies, so the current ~2 s/cycle is a *floor* — real defense
  learning would blow out the ETA. Filed as a feedback memory so future
  sessions don't quote naive ETAs.
- Added live SUMMARY to [../TRAINING_WIKI.md](../TRAINING_WIKI.md) with
  the eval table, plies puzzle, and open questions to resolve as the run
  continues (does heuristic hold, does lookahead2 climb, do plies
  regrow, head-to-head vs kze-e176).

## [2026-05-19] notebook | az-recipe-160k diagnostics resolved: real defense

- ~280 epochs after the SUMMARY was written, every "open question"
  diagnostic resolved in favor of real defense being learned, not
  offense-only. lookahead:depth=2 climbed from 12% (e1119) to 55%
  (e1507). selfplay/plies_p90 spikes to 60-80 at e1.5k+, eval times
  doubled-to-tripled as games got longer.
- Jason flagged the **selfplay/plies_p90** chart as the leading
  indicator before it showed up in the mean. Filed as a tactical note
  in the wiki: when the model is in transition between offense-only
  and real-play, p90 is more sensitive than mean because the
  distribution is bimodal (short attack wins + long defense games).
- This recipe + cutback combo is the first in the wiki to break the
  fast-attack collapse: no prior dist run crossed lookahead2 above 25%.
- Speculation on what made the difference: most likely τ_final=0.1
  (soft policy targets instead of degenerate one-hot), then AGZ
  log-PUCT, then 1.5M replay. A τ_final=0 ablation would resolve it.

## [2026-05-19] notebook | az-recipe-160k e2179 checkpoint — full regime change

- At e2179 (43% complete, 2:47h wall-clock), the self-play plies have
  fully regrown to 27-32 mean — the same range as the e1 untrained
  baseline, but for the opposite reason: defense, not random play.
- Loss/policy down to 0.76 from 4.22 at e1. Loss/value at 0.08 — model
  is very confident. No sign of value-head collapse to z=0/-1 (the
  classic failure mode from earlier runs).
- Elo eval shipped at e1854 (commit fa656b9); model_elo bouncing
  1085-1183 across e1854/2148/2159/2167. Stable around 1100-1150,
  between heuristic (anchor 800) and lookahead2 (anchor 1200).
- ETA blowout exactly as Jason's calibration predicted: cycle time
  grew 2s → 15s as plies regrew. Total projected ~14.6h vs original
  10h estimate. The interesting outcome (real defense) was always the
  one that costs wall-clock.
- Anchor Elo calibration script running in background to replace the
  seeded ANCHOR_ELOS with measured values from a round-robin between
  random + heuristic + lookahead{2,3,4,5}. Will update rating.py when
  calibration finishes.
