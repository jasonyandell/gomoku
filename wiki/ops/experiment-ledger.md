# ML Perf Experiment Ledger

Append concise receipts here after the curator reads worker open notes. Worker-specific detail can live under `wiki/ops/open-notes/`.

## Training-Quality Promotion Gate

Perf changes that touch training behavior, inference outputs, MCTS/search behavior, replay/data encoding, checkpoint refresh cadence, or game-start distribution need more than throughput. A receipt may not use `decision: promote` unless it records all of the following:

1. **Named quality gate before the run.** Use at least one fixed external baseline or fixed validation archive. Current named options are:
   - external baselines: `heuristic`, `lookahead:depth=2`, and/or `lookahead:depth=4` via the match/eval harness with alternating colors;
   - validation archive: `archives/wl5_validation_v1.pt`, reporting at least `val/policy_ce`, `val/policy_kl`, and `val/value_mse` against the parent/reference checkpoint.
2. **Game-shape guardrail.** Report `selfplay/plies_mean` and, when available, `selfplay/plies_p90` or equivalent game-length distribution. Promotion is blocked or marked `needs_repeat` if the candidate shows sustained fast-attack collapse: falling plies, shorter-game buffer-fill concavity, or a material drop below the parent run's game-length band without an explicit strength explanation.
3. **Short-eval noise policy.** State game count and uncertainty. `n < 20` is smoke only and cannot support a strength claim. `n=20` can be a canary but normally needs a repeat or archive agreement for promotion. Prefer `n >= 50` or two independent same-shape `n >= 20` reads for behavior-changing promotion; otherwise use `decision: needs_repeat`.
4. **Reproducibility IDs.** Behavior-changing perf receipts must include checkpoint path(s), W&B run ID(s) or explicit `wandb: disabled`, commit hash, seed policy, and env/backend flags such as `GOMOKU_DISABLE_NATIVE_MCTS`, `GOMOKU_DISABLE_NATIVE_STATE_OPS`, `PYTORCH_ENABLE_MPS_FALLBACK`, device, model size, stem padding, sims, wave size, workers, and evaluator backend.
5. **Explicit decision.** Every receipt ends with `decision: promote | reject | blocked | needs_repeat`. Throughput-only wins that lack the selected quality gate, plies/game-shape read, or reproducibility IDs are not promotions; mark them `blocked` if the harness/artifact is missing or `needs_repeat` if the evidence is merely noisy/short.

## Receipts

### 2026-05-22 — production WL1-shaped self-play throughput seed

```yaml
lane: production-contour-sweep
hypothesis: Native MCTS plus 8 smaller workers remains better than fewer wider workers under a trainer-shaped wave-mode production sweep.
code_ref: 4f21cdd worktree /Users/jason/code/gomoku-perf-extension
dataset_ref: fresh self-play only; 10 trainer epochs per cell
baseline_command: exact launcher command not captured in ops ledger; reconstructed shape is WL1 10-epoch sweep, small model, 400 sims, wave 64, 8 workers x 8 games, Python MCTS fallback via GOMOKU_DISABLE_NATIVE_MCTS=1
candidate_command: exact launcher command not captured in ops ledger; same shape with native MCTS enabled, plus native 4 workers x 16 games comparison
hardware: M5 Max / MPS
seed: not recorded in summary TSV
baseline_metric: fallback 8w8g wall=1863 aug_pos/s, gen=2264 aug_pos/s, wall=8.85 games/s
candidate_metric: native 8w8g wall=2379 aug_pos/s, gen=3303 aug_pos/s, wall=11.25 games/s; native 4w16g wall=1918 aug_pos/s, gen=2152 aug_pos/s, wall=8.61 games/s
delta: native 8w8g vs fallback 8w8g = 1.28x wall aug_pos/s and 1.46x gen aug_pos/s; native 8w8g vs native 4w16g = 1.24x wall aug_pos/s and 1.53x gen aug_pos/s
confidence: medium; 10 epochs each, production-shaped but short and from worktree artifacts
artifacts: /Users/jason/code/gomoku-perf-extension/sweep_logs/perf10-summary.tsv and matching trainer/worker logs
commands_run: exact launcher command not captured in ops ledger; trainer logs record device/model/wave barrier shape
decision: needs_repeat
next_action: Use this as seed evidence for the production-contour-sweep lane, but rerun current-main baseline receipts with explicit command capture before treating it as a promotion gate.
```

### 2026-05-22 — current-main baseline receipts microbench

```yaml
lane: baseline-receipts
hypothesis: Current-main native MCTS remains materially faster than the Python MCTS fallback on the standard production-shaped MPS microbench, and the raw-output artifact convention is sufficient for future citation.
code_ref: a418f677b831488a71333a3e60d3a0ca7108dbfc on frontier/20260522T054739Z/01-baseline-receipts; same commit as /Users/jason/code/gomoku main at measurement time
dataset_ref: fresh self-play microbench only; no training dataset; seed=0

candidate_command: python scripts/perf_microbench.py --device mps --size small --stem-padding 1 --games 8 --n-simulations 400 --wave-size 64 --max-plies 16 --repeats 3
hardware: MacBook Pro Mac17,6; Apple M5 Max; 18 cores (6 Super, 12 Performance); 48 GB; MPS; live WL5 trainer + 8 self-play workers + eval worker active
seed: 0
baseline_metric: fallback median 2.309s; 3.46 games/s; 443 aug pos/s; plies_mean 16.0; native_mcts=false; native_state_ops=true; fused_eval=true
candidate_metric: native median 0.626s; 12.79 games/s; 1,637 aug pos/s; plies_mean 16.0; native_mcts=true; native_state_ops=true; fused_eval=true
delta: native vs fallback = 3.69x lower median seconds and 3.70x higher games/s and aug_pos/s under paired live contention
confidence: medium; paired same-shape repeats on current main, but absolute MPS numbers are contended by live WL5 and should be repeated on an idle machine for stable reference rows
artifacts: sweep_logs/frontier-baselines/20260522T054845Z/{metadata.txt,commands.txt,summary.tsv,summary.json,cpu-smoke-native.txt,cpu-smoke-fallback.txt,mps-microbench-native.txt,mps-microbench-fallback.txt,pytest-q.txt}

  - pytest -q
decision: promote
next_action: Curator can treat this as the current-main contended baseline receipt and artifact convention; repeat the MPS pair when WL5 is idle if absolute comparison to the older 2,200 aug pos/s reference matters.
